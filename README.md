# habit-bot
As a project for the Hack the North hackathon I decided to work on an alternate
take on habit tracking. I decided to make a facebook messenger bot to act as an
interface and reminder for the user, creating a friendlier environment. I got 
to work with the Facebook Messenger and NLP APIs, using mostly Node.js to 
program both the front and back-end. With the time constraint, I was able to 
achieve the interface and basic functions, I am currently working on 
implementing smart plans for addiction cessation.
